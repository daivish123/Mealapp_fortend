                    <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: larger; font-style: italic;">Rishabh Software was founded in the year 2000 by Mr. & Mrs. Raju Shah with a simple thought of
                      delivering exceptional value to global customers. From the start, the vision was clear to empower
                      businesses with world-class software solutions. They did this by tapping into local talent in their home
                      state of Gujarat by building a platform for budding software developers to grow and nurture their
                      careers. At Rishabh, we not only provide your business with exceptional enterprise-grade applications
                      but go above and beyond. With 1200+ successful projects and a process-driven mindset, weâ€™ve got your
                      back. Our repeat clientele speaks volumes for our values and ethics in all our dealings be it software
                      development across web, mobile, analytics, cloud, or through our engineering and BPO services. We
                      believe in doing the best for our clients because WE CARE.</p>
